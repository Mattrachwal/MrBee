                <h4>Preventative Treatment</h4>
                <p>
                    Our preventative treatment targets stinging insects that nest both inside and on the exterior of the home. This is a one time treatment done in the spring and early summer months to target the queens that begin nesting during those times. The technition uses a chemical dust to target the cracks and crevases of the standing structions on the customers property. A liquid may also be used in certain cercumstances if the customer requires it. This treatment is warrentied until the end of the calander year and covers the entire property in the case of ground or tree nests.

                <h4>Nest Treatment</h4>
                <p>
                    Customers may also choose treatment based on individual locations or nests. If the customer chooses this the price will fluctuate based on the type and number of nests they wish treated. Prevention is almost always the cheapest and most effective method for stinging insect control but not always possible considering the nature of these pests.

                    you will have fewer numbers flying around your property, making for a much nicer summer. Pricing is based on the square footage of your home and in most cases costs less than two One Spot Treatments. Please contact our office for more information
