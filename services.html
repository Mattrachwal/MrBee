                        <h4>Preventative Treatment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our preventative treatment targets stinging insects that nest both inside and on the exterior of the home. This is a one time treatment done in the spring and early summer months to target the queens that begin nesting during those times. The technician uses a chemical dust to target the cracks and crevasses of the standing structures on the customer's property. This treatment is warrantied until the end of the calender year and covers the entire property in the case of ground or tree nests.

                        <h4>Nest Treatment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Customers may also choose treatment based on individual locations or nests. If the customer chooses this the price will fluctuate based on the type and number of nests they wish treated. Prevention is almost always the cheapest and most effective method for stinging insect control but not always possible considering the nature of these pests.

                        <h4>Nuisance Insect Treatment</h4>
                        <p>
                            These insects include ants, spiders, box elder bugs, asian lady beatles, and recently new to Wisconsin, stink bugs. The  treatment involves spraying a liquid chemical around the perimeter of the house and possibly other structures as well as high insect population problem areas. Some of these insects can be controlled with a one time treatment in the fall, while others are better controlled with monthly applications.
